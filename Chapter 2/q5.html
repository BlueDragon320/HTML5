    <p>The Boeing 777X is the latest series of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_length">long-range</a> , wide-body, twin-engine jetliners in the Boeing 777 family from Boeing Commercial Airplanes. The changes for 777X include GE9X engines, composite wings with folding wingtips, greater cabin width and seating capacity, and technologies from the Boeing 787. The 777X was launched in November 2013 with two variants: the 777-8 and the 777-9. The 777-8 provides seating for 395 passengers and has a range of 8,745 nmi (16,196 km; 10,064 mi) while the 777-9 has seating for 426 passengers and a range of over 7,285 nmi (13,492 km; 8,383 mi).

        The 777X program was proposed in the early 2010s with assembly at the Boeing Everett Factory and the wings built at a new adjacent building. As of June 2024, there are 501 total orders for the 777X passenger and freighter versions from thirteen identified customers and unnamed buyer(s).[4] The 777-9 first flew on January 25, 2020. Deliveries have been delayed multiple times; as of October 2024, Boeing expects the first aircraft to be delivered in 2026. </p>
